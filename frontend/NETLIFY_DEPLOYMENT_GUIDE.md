- ‚úÖ Domain purchased from Namecheap
- ‚úÖ GitHub account
- ‚úÖ Netlify account (free)

---

## üéØ Step 1: Prepare Your Project for Deployment

### 1.1 Create Build Configuration
First, let's create a Netlify-specific configuration file:

```bash
# In your frontend directory
touch netlify.toml
```

Add this content to `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[[headers]]
  for = "/static/*"
  [headers.values]
    cache-control = "max-age=31536000"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.css"
  [headers.values]
    cache-control = "max-age=31536000"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.js"
  [headers.values]
    cache-control = "max-age=31536000"
```

### 1.2 Test Local Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Make sure everything works correctly locally.

## üîó Step 2: Push to GitHub

### 2.1 Initialize Git (if not already done)
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Ready for Netlify deployment"
```

### 2.2 Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New Repository"
3. Name it: `satis-fact-engineering-website`
4. Keep it public
5. Don't initialize with README (you already have one)
6. Click "Create Repository"

### 2.3 Connect Local to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/satis-fact-engineering-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## üåê Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

### 3.1 Create Netlify Account
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account (recommended)
3. This will automatically connect your GitHub repositories

### 3.2 Deploy from GitHub
1. **Click "New Site from Git"**
2. **Choose "GitHub"**
3. **Select your repository** (`satis-fact-engineering-website`)
4. **Configure build settings:**
   - **Base directory:** `frontend`
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `frontend/dist`
5. **Click "Deploy Site"**

### 3.3 Wait for Deployment
- First deployment takes 2-5 minutes

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Issue 2: CSS/JS Files Not Loading
**Solution:** Check that your build process is creating files in the correct `dist/` directory.
